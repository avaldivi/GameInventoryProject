# GameInventoryProject

Summary: Game Inventory of 3 type of games (PC,Mobile,Console) consisting of 8 games total. The games are read from a .txt. file into the Console and organized into small blocks into a new .txt file. Each game can be deleted and then saved into the .txt file so that It does not come up again. Binary Search Tree classes are implemented to to create the postorder and preorder of games in the order. It will created in post order and pre order use the comparable interface implement in Games class to compare the game name and game type.

Use Game class and its subclasses from Homework 1.  Modify them so that they implements the Comparable interface.  (This means you need to add the appropriate compareTo method).   Use name and gaming platform to determine less than or greater than.  If name is alphabetically greater than or less than, use that to determine greater than or less than.  If name is alphabetically equal, use name of gaming platform to determine whether greater than or less than or equal to.

Create a binary search tree of Games’s.   Add 6 new Games’s to your text file from Homework 1 and read then all into the binary search tree.  Be sure to implement a post-order traversal and a pre-order traversal.

Once the Games’s are in the tree, print the names in post-order and pre-order traversal.  Clearly indicate which is which.

Note:  If you are unhappy with your homework 1 classes- you may use the ones provided in Homework 1 solution in content.  However, clearly mark that you used these as starting points in the class headers.
